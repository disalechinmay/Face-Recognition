# Face-Recognition

This project is aimed towards creation of facial recognition system which could be used in a distributed environment through hashing.

Project is divided into two modules:

MODULE I : Face recognition system which takes in username and check if the recognised face is correct according to the username.

	( Check /"Detect with username" directory )



MODULE II : Face recognition system which checks recognised face against all faces available in our trained data source.

	( Check /"Detect without username" directory )
